Each perovskite connection is 2 Ohms
------------------------
Lower resistor values do not help
------------------------
The 0 line of each BCD to decimal decoder will always be on.
To fix this, the 0 lines can be pulled, limiting the decoder to 14 perovskites
The current source and GaAs cell decoder outputs can be pulled and used 
This fix worked, only one output enabled at a time
------------------------
Switch to 4:16 decoder which have inhibit lines (CD4514BM96), tie inhibit line to current enable line
What to do with strobe line?
Break out remaining 12 outputs to an expansion header, create an expansion board that exposes 12 more panel inputs
------------------------
Separate each BCD counter reset to separate I/O pin
------------------------
The ADC clock was probably wrong(?), I used a HCMOS rather than an LVCMOS and the waveform looked terrible on the scope.
Put together new boards, ordered from JLCPCB, and test using a waveform generator and see if that fixes the ADC problems
------------------------
The op amp can't source/sink enough current to drive the panels directly
The negative voltage charge pump can't produce enough current to drive the panel input either
Likely need to use a FET with op amp for feedback to control a voltage source into the panel
I don't think this will be working in time for the cubesat
Otherwise, the DAC works well, the voltage source generation (-0.3 to 1.2) works correctly, and the charge pump works with low load.
SIT8924BA-22-33E-8.192000 is the clock used by the eval kit from TI
------------------------
I have a board that will work for the vibration testing, but I need to clear up these other problems first

------------------------

It looks like when the COM node is the positive lead, there is influence from the other panels on the target panel.  This could probably be compensated for by connecting the bottom of the voltage divider to 3V3, so that it shifts negative voltages up to positive.  This would allow that fix.
